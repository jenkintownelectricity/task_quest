## Evidence-Based Interventions Incorporated

### 1. Token Economy System

#### Research Foundation
Token economies are classified as a **"well-established, evidence-based treatment for ADHD"** based on numerous randomized clinical trials, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses (Pfiffner & Haack, 2014).

> "This technique uses as consequence strategy awards of points or tokens for desirable behavior (positive contingency reinforcement) and may condition significant impairments to display of inappropriate behaviors such as withdrawal of a previously gained token (response cost)."
>
> — Rijo et al., 2015, PMC4659172

#### Implementation in Application
- **Coins** awarded immediately upon task completion
- **XP (Experience Points)** for progression tracking
- **Reward Shop** where coins can be exchanged for privileges
- **Response cost** capability (tasks can be unchecked, removing rewards)

#### Efficacy Data
A 2024 study published in Bioengineering confirmed the effectiveness of digital token economy interventions:

> "In relation to the behaviors analyzed, there was a significant intervention time effect for seven of the eleven categories analyzed: impulsiveness, hyperactivity, disorganization, disobeying routine, poor self-care, easily frustrated, and antisocial behaviors."
>
> — MDPI Bioengineering, 2024

**Citation:** https://www.mdpi.com/2306-5354/12/10/1035

---

### 2. Immediate Reinforcement

#### Research Foundation
Children with ADHD demonstrate reduced sensitivity to delayed reinforcement, making immediate feedback critical for behavior modification.

> "Children with ADHD relative to those without ADHD are less responsive to inconsistent, delayed and weak reinforcement, and are less responsive to cues of punishment or non-reward."
>
> — Pfiffner & Haack, 2014, PMC4167345

> "The reward must be given immediately after the behavior occurs (i.e. present a token or write in a point on the spot, not at the end of the day). Tokens must be given every time in the beginning."
>
> — University of Washington CBT+ Token Economy Guide, 2017

#### Implementation in Application
- Instant visual feedback (confetti animation, XP popup)
- Immediate coin/XP deposit upon task completion
- Real-time progress bar updates
- Audio feedback capability
- Voice assistant praise option

#### Efficacy Data
A 2025 randomized controlled study found:

> "The combination of coins and verbal encouragement had the most effective motivational impact, not only increasing task interest but also enhancing children's sense of achievement."
>
> — JMIR Serious Games, 2025

**Citation:** https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11894355/

---

### 3. Visual Schedules and Supports

#### Research Foundation
Visual schedules are **well-established interventions** that reduce cognitive load and support executive function deficits common in ADHD.

> "Visual schedules support and scaffold weakness in executive functions common to learners with ADHD. They support working memory by providing a concrete example of verbal directions, reducing the cognitive load."
>
> — OT4ADHD, 2022

> "The visual activity schedule (VAS) intervention program is a frequently used method to teach multiple skills involving on-task behavior, use of schedules, transition behaviors, social initiation, independent play skills, classroom skills, and academic skills."
>
> — PMC8733412, 2022

#### Implementation in Application
- Tasks organized by time of day (Morning, School, Afternoon, Evening)
- Visual icons for each task category
- Progress percentage displays
- Checkmark completion indicators
- Color-coded difficulty badges

#### Efficacy Data
> "A study in the Journal of Special Education Technology found that students with ADHD who used visual timers improved their on-task behavior by 37% compared to traditional time management approaches."

**Citation:** https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8733412/

---

### 4. Task Chunking / Task Analysis

#### Research Foundation
Executive function delays in children with ADHD (approximately 30% behind chronological age) make large tasks overwhelming. Breaking tasks into smaller steps is an evidence-based accommodation.

> "Large tasks can overwhelm children with executive function challenges. Breaking assignments into smaller, concrete steps makes them more approachable. Research from the University of California shows that task analysis and sequencing significantly reduces anxiety and improves completion rates."
>
> — SF Mind Matters

> "Chunking tasks means breaking down larger tasks or assignments into smaller, manageable parts... Evidence-based strategies customized for children with ADHD include classroom accommodations, instructional modifications, and teaching strategies such as attention and focus techniques using short-focused activities with breaks."
>
> — Resistances Journal, 2023

#### Implementation in Application
- Morning routine broken into 6 discrete steps (5-10 minutes each)
- School tasks separated by specific behavior targets
- Built-in time limits (3-30 minutes per task)
- Optional timer function for focus periods

**Citation:** https://www.skillpointtherapy.com/executive-functioning-help/

---

### 5. Gamification and Digital Therapeutics

#### Research Foundation
Gamified interventions represent an emerging evidence-based approach for ADHD, with multiple 2024-2025 studies demonstrating efficacy.

> "Eighty children aged 6–12 years with clinically diagnosed ADHD were randomly assigned to a gamified intervention group or a control group. The improvements observed were maintained at follow-up, suggesting that the effects of gamified interventions on attentional performance may extend beyond the immediate training period."
>
> — Frontiers in Education, 2025

> "Of the 35 studies identified (1,408 participants), analysis revealed: 80% assessed attention, 29% addressed hyperactivity-impulsivity, 17% explored improvements in social skills, 20% evaluated motor skills, and 43% investigated executive functions. Furthermore, in 89% of the trials, children exhibited a positive attitude toward game interventions."
>
> — JMIR Serious Games Systematic Review, 2025

#### Implementation in Application
- Level progression system (Level 1-100)
- Achievement badges with rarity tiers
- Journey map narrative (31 US destinations)
- Streak tracking for consistency motivation
- Unlockable content tied to progress

### 6. Visual Timers

#### Research Foundation
Time blindness is a core executive function deficit in ADHD. Visual timers provide external time awareness support.

> "Visual timers help children understand time passage, which is particularly important for children with ADHD who often experience 'time blindness.'"
>
> — Goally, 2024

#### Implementation in Application
- Countdown timer for timed tasks
- Visual display of remaining minutes
- Optional timer for any task
- Completion prompt when timer ends

**Citation:** https://getgoally.com/blog/5-adhd-time-management-tips-for-kids/

---

### 7. Multi-Stakeholder Collaboration

#### Research Foundation
Consistent reinforcement across settings (home, school, therapy) improves intervention outcomes.

> "Home token economies work best when caregivers consistently reinforce target behaviors. Parent training in token economy implementation shows improved outcomes."
>
> — Yellow Bus ABA, 2024

#### Implementation in Application
- Role-based access system with distinct permissions:
  - **Parents (Mom, Dad, Chriss):** Full admin, verify, reward
  - **Grandparents, Uncle:** Verify, encourage
  - **Teacher:** Add tasks, verify, report
  - **Therapist:** Add tasks, verify, adjust goals
  - **Sister (Giuliana):** Encourage, team challenges
- Shared progress visibility across all stakeholders
- Custom task creation for individualized goals

**Citation:** https://www.yellowbusaba.com/post/how-to-implement-a-token-economy-at-home-through-parent-training

---

### 8. Reward Variety and Rotation

#### Research Foundation
Children with ADHD require novel stimuli to maintain motivation. Static reward menus lose effectiveness over time.

> "For children with ADD, new rewards should be continually rotated into the reward 'menu' in order to keep the rewards meaningful."
>
> — Western Oregon University, Classroom Token Economy Guide

#### Implementation in Application
- Four reward categories (Screen Time, Activities, Treats, Special)
- 15+ pre-loaded reward options
- Admin panel for adding custom rewards
- Varied point costs (40-1000 coins) for goal diversity

**Citation:** https://people.wou.edu/~girodm/middle/classroom_token_economy.pdf

---

### 9. Targeting Specific 504 Plan Goals

#### Research Foundation
Token economies are most effective when targeting specific, observable behaviors aligned with educational/therapeutic goals.

> "Token economy can be used to increase the attention duration of children with ADHD in completing school tasks. The reinforcement or token that is made in an interesting form, and is directly given to children may motivate them to repeat the target behavior."
>
> — ResearchGate, 2020

#### Implementation in Application

| 504 Goal | App Task | Points |
|----------|----------|--------|
| Remain seated during instruction | "Stay in Seat Challenge" | 50 XP, 25 coins |
| Raise hand before speaking | "Raise Hand First" | 40 XP, 20 coins |
| Track assignments | "Write Down Homework" | 30 XP, 15 coins |
| Bring materials home | "Bring All Materials Home" | 35 XP, 15 coins |
| Organization | "Pack Backpack" | 25 XP, 10 coins |
| Screen time limits | "Screens Off On Time" | 45 XP, 25 coins |

**Citation:** https://www.researchgate.net/publication/346019449_Applying_token_economy_to_improve_attention_of_child_with_ADHD

---

### 10. Interest-Based Learning Integration

#### Research Foundation
Connecting interventions to the child's intrinsic interests increases engagement and motivation.

> "By leveraging multisensory stimuli such as visuals, sounds, and interactivity, gamified tools not only support improvements in attention but also enhance motivation through interactive engagement, instant feedback, and reward mechanisms."
>
> — Frontiers in Education, 2025

#### Implementation in Application
- **Maps/Geography** (documented interest): Journey map features 31 real US towns with fun facts and "hidden gems"
- **Math** (documented strength): "Math Challenge" bonus quests
- **Roblox** (documented motivator): Roblox time as primary screen time reward
